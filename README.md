# chatbot-project
A simple chat-bot project with NLP methods.

My first try on building a chatbot! : using just a few QnA pairs and basic NLP functions.

--> It can succesfully be used in [BotPress](https://botpress.com) and [Microsoft Bot Framework Composer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/composer/introduction?tabs=v2x) !
